# Trigger the workflow on push events for the main branch
# and on pull requests targeting the main branch.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Define the jobs to be run
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner for the job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define the steps to be executed in the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      # This action checks out your repository so your workflow can access it.
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      # This action sets up a specific version of Node.js. We use v20.x for compatibility.
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
          cache: 'npm' # Enable caching for npm dependencies

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # Installs project dependencies using npm ci for a clean install based on package-lock.json.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run linters and formatters
      # Executes Biome for code linting and formatting. This ensures code quality and consistency.
      - name: Lint and format with Biome
        run: npm run lint && npm run format

      # Step 5: Run unit tests
      # Executes unit tests using Vitest. This step verifies the functionality of individual components.
      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: npm test

      # Step 6: Build the application
      # Builds the production-ready application using Vite. This step generates optimized assets.
      # NOTE: Assuming a build script exists in package.json, e.g., "build": "vite build"
      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 7: Upload build artifacts (optional but good practice)
      # Archives the built application for potential deployment or further inspection.
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist-artifact
          path: dist/ # Adjust path if your build output directory is different

# NOTE: This CI configuration is designed for a TypeScript/Node.js/Vite project.
# If the project's stack deviates significantly (e.g., purely Python for backend without Node.js build), 
# this workflow will need adjustments. Based on the provided context ('TypeScript' language),
# this configuration is deemed appropriate.
# 
# For projects exclusively in Python without a Node.js build step, a different CI workflow
# utilizing Python versions, pip/uv, Ruff, and Pytest would be necessary.
# Example: 
#   - name: Set up Python
#     uses: actions/setup-python@v5
#     with:
#       python-version: '3.10'
#       cache: 'pip' # or 'uv'
#   - name: Install Python dependencies
#     run: |
#       pip install --upgrade pip
#       pip install -r requirements.txt
#       # or uv pip sync requirements.txt
#   - name: Lint with Ruff
#     run: ruff check .
#   - name: Run Pytest
#     run: pytest
