# Security Policy

The CogniFlow AI team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and we will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us as soon as possible. We request that you **do not** disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to address it.

**Please email your findings to:** `security@example.com` (Note: This is a placeholder. A real project should have a dedicated security contact).

When reporting a vulnerability, please include the following details:

- A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
- The steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or videos that can help us understand the issue.
- The potential impact of the vulnerability.

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and provide you with a timeline for addressing the issue.

## Scope

This security policy applies to the `main` branch of the `CogniFlow-AI-PDF-Conversational-Summarizer-Web-App` repository.

## Our Commitment

- We will work with you to understand and validate your report.
- We will not take legal action against you for your responsible disclosure.
- We will do our best to keep you informed about the progress of our investigation and remediation.
- We will publicly acknowledge your contribution once the vulnerability has been addressed, if you wish.

Thank you for helping to keep CogniFlow AI secure.
